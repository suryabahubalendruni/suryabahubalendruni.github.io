description1: KIPP St. Louis is a charter school network that helps children from low-income households surpass socioeconomic hurdles and attend college. As of Fall 2015, they provide an extended day, extended year educational program that serves grades K-8.

description2: The Taylor Community Consulting Program (TCCP) connects student teams with local non-profits. These teams tackle the problems the non-profits face in a consulting engagement, developing a solution for their client while maintaining regular communication with the non-profit to ensure their satisfaction.  

description3: As a part of TCCP, our team developed a <a href="KIPP St. Louis Final Report.pdf">feasibility study</a> to determine the likelihood of KIPP St. Louis opening and operating a high performing college-preparatory high school. The study's contents included an executive summary, a competitive landscape analysis, a SWOT analysis, administrator and student interviews, and an opening plan. After creating our feasibility analysis and formulating a solution, we presented our findings to KIPP St. Louis' board of directors and other interested parties.
