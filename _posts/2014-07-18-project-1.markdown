description1: Winston Grand is an algorithmic trading fund I started with a classmate. The fund went live in April 2016 with $300K in seed capital and a primary focus on emerging cryptocurrencies, bolstering an impressive 220% return over the 5 months since. 

description2: I grew greatly as a programmer through Winston Grand. While working on this project,I  created book building software that takes in real-time market tick data for cryptocurrencies on various exchanges and efficiently constructs the book for a set depth, achieving low latency and optimal performance by implementing Red-Black Trees and Deques as data structures. Beyond testing my ability to understand and apply algorithms and data structures, I also grew adept at implementing databases. In the processing of building a full trading system, I designed a custom backend that compresses, chunks and versions tick data to meet the needs of our high-frequency trading platform. 

description3: I also grew greatly as a trader through Winston Grand. I assisted in building high-frequency trading strategies that take advantage of latent arbitrage opportunities between and within cryptocurrency exchanges. To handle exeuction, I assisted designing a system with mature portfolio and risk management as well as complex entry/exit technique.
