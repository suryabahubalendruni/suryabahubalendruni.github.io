description1: • Comanaged an algorithmic trading fund that went live in April 2016 with $300K in seed capital and a primary focus on emerging cryptocurrencies, bolstering an impressive 220% return to date
• Created book building software that takes in real-time market tick data for cryptocurrencies on various exchanges and efficiently constructs the book for a set depth, achieving low latency and optimal performance by implementing Red-Black Trees and Deques as data structures
• Designed a custom backend that compresses, chunks and versions tick data to meet the needs of our high-frequency trading platform
• Built high-frequency trading strategies that take advantage of latent arbitrage opportunities between and within cryptocurrency exchanges
• Built an automated trade execution system with mature portfolio and risk management as well as complex entry/exit technique



description2: We create end-of-day and intraday algorithms and back test on historical data to find potential biases and flaws in the strategies. After we conduct extensive sensitivity analyses and get a clear understanding of the risk and profitability of our algorithms, we implement them in an automated execution system through our brokerage account.


description3: Our historical trade tick data is hosted on Amazon Cloud instances. We analyze and manipulate this data directly on the instance with Python in conjunction with various data analysis libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Graphlab-Create, Scikit-Learn and Pyswarm. Our brokerage account is hosted at Interactive Brokers and interacted with through an automated execution system built on Interactive Brokers’ API.
