                  <p>I'm a sophomore pursuing a BSBA at Washington University in St. Louis with majors in Economics & Strategy and Mathematics, along with a minor in Computer Science. </p>
                  <p>I am excited by opportunities where my academic interests converge and thus find a variety of fields in business extremely appealing. In particular, I am interested in high-frequency trading, algorithmic trading, private equity and venture capital. I greatly enjoy tasks and projects involving corporate strategy, data analysis, machine learning and optimization. 
                  </p>
                  <p> I have some programming experience in a few languages. I am proficient in Python, Java, C and Arduino. In addition, I have moderate experience with R, SAS and Assembly. I also have some working knowledge in web development, particularly with HTML, CSS and Jekyll. 
                   My approach to computer science has a fair bit of independence and autonomy. I am a quick and independent learner, and am always excited to explore unfamiliar and daunting problems in my spare time.
