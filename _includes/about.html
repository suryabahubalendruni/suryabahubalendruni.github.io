                  I'm a sophomore pursuing a BSBA at Washington University in St. Louis with majors in Economics &amp; Strategy and Mathematics, along with a minor in Computer Science.
                  I am excited by opportunities where my academic interests converge and thus find a variety of fields in business extremely appealing. 
                  For example, some industries I am interested in include algorithmic trading, high frequency trading, information technology, accounting, consulting, private equity and venture capital.

                  To put my interests broadly, I enjoy the process of dissecting complex and ambiguous problems and building elegant and novel solutions.
                  I love any work with this process at its core, whether it's computer programming, data science, entrepreneurship, or anything else.
                  I am always willing to explore new and exciting applications and projects, regardless of how difficult they may be.

                  I have experience with a few different programming languages and tools. As far as languages go, I am proficient with Python, Java, and C. 
                  In addition, I have moderate experience with R, SAS, Assembly, Arduino, HTML and CSS.
                  The tools I am familiar with are Git, Apache SVN, MySQL, Jekyll, and some applications in the Adobe Creative Cloud suite, including Dreamweaver, Illustrator and InDesign.

                  When I'm not working, I enjoy road trips and cruises with my family and friends. 
                  I like watching Rick and Morty, It's Always Sunny, and Silicon Valley in my downtime as well.
                  In addition, I love supporting the Bengals, Browns, Cavaliers, and other Ohio sports teams through the good and (usually) bad times.
