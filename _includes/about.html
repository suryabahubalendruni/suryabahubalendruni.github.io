                  I am excited by opportunities where my academic interests converge and thus find a variety of fields in business extremely appealing. 
                  In particular, I am interested in algorithmic trading, high frequency trading, information technology, accounting, consulting, private equity and venture capital. 
                  I love computer programming, data science and entrepreneurship and am always willing to explore new and exciting applications and projects.

                  I have experience with a few different programming languages and tools. As far as languages go, I am proficient with Python, Java, and C. 
                  In addition, I have moderate experience with R, SAS, Assembly, Arduino, HTML and CSS.
                  The tools I am familiar with are Git, Apache SVN, MySQL, Jekyll, and some applications in the Adobe Creative Cloud suite, including Dreamweaver, Illustrator and InDesign.
