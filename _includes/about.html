                  <p>I'm a sophomore pursuing a BSBA at Washington University in St. Louis with majors in Finance and Mathematics, and a minor in Computer Science. </p>
                  <p>I am excited by opportunities where my academic interests converge. Thus, fields like high-frequency trading, algorithmic trading, data analysis, machine learning and mathematical optimization pique my interest.
                  I've always been attracted to the markets because of my competitive nature. I have a great deal of intrinsic motivation towards trading because of the unadulterated competition it offers.  
                  </p>
                  <p> I have some programming background in a few languages. I am proficient in Java, Python, R, C and C++. I also have some working knowledge in web development, particularly with the languages and generators HTML, Ruby and Jekyll. 
                   My approach to computer science has a fair bit of independence and autonomy. I am a quick and independent learner, and am always excited to explore unfamiliar and daunting problems and languages in my spare time.
